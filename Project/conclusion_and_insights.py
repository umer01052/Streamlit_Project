    This project has been a comprehensive journey through COVID-19 vaccination data, involving several critical steps:

    1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
       - Explored the structure and content of the dataset.
       - Identified patterns, trends, and potential data quality issues.

    2. **Data Preprocessing:**
       - Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset for consistency.
       - Transformed variables and prepared the data for modeling.

    3. **Model Training:**
       - Built and trained machine learning models to predict outcomes or classify data.
       - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy.

    4. **Visualization and Deployment:**
       - Created insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
       - Developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time interaction with the data and model predictions.
